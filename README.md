# PoshX
A simple PowerShell profile to make it look a bit like the Terminal on OSX.

## Installation
 Copy the ps1-file into the PowerShell profile folder:

default: C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell

You might need to set the backcolor to "White" manually once by running PowerShell, right-clicking the title bar. Then go to "Properties" and set the backcolor to "White". You can close the PowerShell console now.

New instances will start in the desired new style.

Have fun.
