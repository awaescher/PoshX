# PoshX
A simple PowerShell profile to make its console window look a bit like the Terminal on OSX.

## Installation
1. Copy the ps1-file into the PowerShell profile folder:

`default: C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`

2. You might need to set the backcolor to "White" manually once. *Run PowerShell, right-click the title bar, go to "Properties", tab "Colors", checkbox "Screen Background" and choose "White". You can close the PowerShell console now.*

New instances will start in the desired new style.

Have fun.
